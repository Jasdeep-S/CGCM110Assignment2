								<h2 class="major">AI And Printing</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" />3D printing a functional prototype (3D Printing Prototype, n.d.)</span>
								<p>Artificial Intelligence has opened the door to many new possibilities within the printing industry. With its recent implementation, graphic communication companies are capable of developing environmentally friendly solutions, leverage 3D printing, and replicate the designs of artists.</p>
								<p><span class="subheading">Environmentally Friendly Printing: </span> As of recent times, the printing industry has been on the lookout for environmentally friendly solutions to replace current practices (Kwality Labels, 2023). In this scenario, artificial intelligence can play an important role to minimize the waste being generated during these processes (Kwality Labels, 2023). These AI models are able to reduce the environmental footprint by minimizing errors and reprints, and by optimizing the amount of ink and materials necessary to output the desired results (Kwality Labels, 2023). </p>
								<p><span class="subheading">3D Printing: </span> Artificial intelligence has the potential to influence the way companies print, by introducing 3D printing (Kwality Labels, 2023). Currently, 3D printing is not widely used in the printing industry, however, it has significant use cases in the future (Kwality Labels, 2023). These powerful AI algorithms are capable of designing 3D renders and models that can be used in various applications (Baitz, 2024). Some of these applications include working with different materials, generating functional prototypes, and developing interactive items for marketing. </p>
								<p><span class="subheading">Challenges/Controversy Regarding AI Usage: </span> When looking at the introduction of artificial intelligence in the printing industry, it is important to analyze the challenges and difficulties. One of the major challenges for printing companies are the initial AI implementation costs (Kwality Labels, 2023). Since these systems can be quite complex in nature, they can be quite expensive (Kwality Labels, 2023). This is particularly a challenge for smaller printing companies, as they may not have a large budget when it comes to integrating AI into their systems (Kwality Labels, 2023). Additionally, when integrating AI into traditional printing systems it is important to provide employees with the proper training (Kwality Labels, 2023). This is essential to ensure that employees can seamlessly adapt to the new technology in place, as AI systems can have quite a learning curve for many individuals. Furthermore, the use of artificial intelligence in this industry has led to concerns regarding ethics, as some critics believe that AI replicating the designs of artists may be a form of plagiarism (Saturno, 2024). Since AI is able to develop imagery that resembles real artists, critics are afraid that this may replace traditional artists (Saturno, 2024). These ethical concerns have led to many creatives avoiding the use of AI models entirely (Saturno, 2024). </p>

								<h2 class="major">AI And Workflow</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpeg" alt="" />Xerox iGen, A digital press that leverages AI to analyze real-time data, to automatically enhance images and detect imperfections (Hossain, 2023).</span>
								<p>A significant aspect of implementing artificial intelligence into any company is its ability to improve workflow. Whether this be through the use of algorithms or chatbots, AI is capable of streamlining mundane tasks, while also providing employees with useful feedback. This in turn can save valuable company time, and allow designers to focus on more creative and complicated tasks. </p>
								<p><span class="subheading">Task Automation:</span> One of the main benefits that artificial intelligence has brought to the graphic communications industry, is its ability to speed up tedious tasks and processes (Mitrović, 2023). AI has the ability to take care of tasks including colour correction, image resizing, and developing layouts (Mitrović, 2023). This allows for minimal human error, and saves time in the development process.</p>
								<p><span class="subheading">Meaningful Feedback:</span> Likewise, designers are given the opportunity to collaborate with artificial intelligence chatbots to get personalized recommendations regarding design choices (Choo, 2024). These powerful AI algorithms are capable of understanding industry trends and user preferences to provide meaningful information (Choo, 2024). This ultimately helps to increase workflow efficiency, as designers have constant access to AI chatbots in the case where design suggestions are necessary (Choo, 2024). </p>
								<p><span class="subheading">AI In Design Software:</span> In addition to providing meaningful feedback, artificial intelligence has found its way into some of the industries most important software applications. When taking a look at graphic design, Adobe has developed its own artificial intelligence platform known as Adobe Sensei (Choo, 2024). This AI has been integrated into pre-existing Adobe applications, including Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro. Adobe Sensei’s capabilities include image recognition, content-aware fill, font matching, and much more (Medium, 2023). The addition of AI to these softwares has proven to significantly speed up the design process (Choo, 2024).</p>
								<p><span class="subheading">Data Analysis:</span>The capabilities of these AI algorithms extend beyond basic routine tasks, as they are capable of analyzing data in real time (Choo, 2024). These artificial intelligence systems make it possible for companies to effortlessly detect inconsistencies within their designs and products (Choo, 2024). A prime example of this is the Xerox iGen digital press, that uses the data analysis capabilities of AI to automate image enhancements and colour management related tasks (Hossain, 2023). This is particularly important in the field of graphic communication, where small details can make a big difference. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Future</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" />Generative Fill, A new AI powered tool implemented into traditional Adobe software (Adobe Photoshop Generative Fill, 2024).</span>
								<p>Looking to the future, it is likely that artificial intelligence is here to stay in the graphic communications industry. Rather than completely replacing artists, AI will work in conjunction with creative minds to produce outstanding designs. </p>
								<p><span class="subheading">Lower Costs of Implementation:</span> As AI technology gets more affordable over the years, it is certain that the implementation costs will decrease as well. This allows for a broad range of companies to be able to access this technology in the future (Medium, 2023). Also, a lower initial investment levels the playing field for smaller companies, as they will also have access to the same technology as their larger competitors (Medium, 2023). </p>
								<p><span class="subheading">Integration with Traditional Processes:</span> Over the years, it is likely that artificial intelligence will not completely replace the traditional design processes in place, but will rather be integrated into them. As we are seeing currently, AI is finding its way into design softwares, such as Adobe Photoshop (Medium, 2023). In the future, it is clear that this trend will continue to rise, as artificial intelligence algorithms are constantly improving and producing more precise results. </p>
								<p><span class="subheading">The Rise of Lazy Design:</span> As artificial intelligence gets more powerful in the future, it is possible that the graphic communications industry may see an increase in lazy design (Boysel, 2023). To be specific, AI could attract designers who will overuse its abilities (Boysel, 2023). This will ultimately lead to lazy and meaningless artwork, causing a rapid decline in creativity (Boysel, 2023). Additionally, this may result in many generic pieces of art appearing in the graphic communications industry, simply because artists are relying heavily on AI (Boysel, 2023). In the future, designers in this field should focus on developing their own unique art, and use artificial intelligence as a tool to enhance their work even further (Boysel, 2023). </p>
